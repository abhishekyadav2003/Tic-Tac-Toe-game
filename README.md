# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This project is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
